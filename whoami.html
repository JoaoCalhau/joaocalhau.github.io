							<p>I am a Software Developer from Ã‰vora, Portugal. I was born in 1995 and have been in touch with technology since my youth. I have been developing since 2012, but has far as real work experience goes, I only started working in 2018 when I was close to delivering my Master's Thesis.</p>
							<p>In Capgemini, I mainly work with Dynamics 365. I have been responsible for the creation and development of various Server Side Plugins and Custom Workflow Activities (C#), as well as a bit of Client Side Scripts (Javascript).</p>
							<p>Although I mainly work with C#, I also have experience with C, Java, Python and SQL, as well as some other languages, which can be found in my CV on LinkedIn.</p>
